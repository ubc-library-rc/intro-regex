# Introduction

If you have heard about regular expressions before, you have probably encountered people who praise them as a kind of coding [superpower](https://xkcd.com/208/).

So, what are regular expressions? What can they be used for? And should you go ahead and use them to parse HTML anyway?

**Regular expressions** (often referred to as **regex** or **regexp**, and abbreviated as **RE**) are a standardized ("regular") way of representing patterns in text using special symbols and syntax ("expressions").

In this workshop, we'll start with learning what regular expressions are and why they're useful. We'll then learn the syntax of regular expressions, take a look at some examples of where they can be useful, and then we'll get some hands on experience using them ourselves with some exercises.
